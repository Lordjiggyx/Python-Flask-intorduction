====== Setup ======

To start using flask the first thing you must actually do is to install it we will do this using pip by running the following command in the terminal

pip install flask

====== Starting a flask application ======

To start in whatever file you plan to run the application in you must import flask

Then you must declare an instance of flask passing in the __name__  keyword


Now for every method you declare in your application it must preceed with an annotattion indictaing the route of the method

@app.route() method passing in a string for the route 

you can then call the app.run() method to run the application

**When you dun a python application it is worthy to note that you can pass in the debug value this allows you to see if there is any errors regarding the application **

You can run the application using command line ot just running it in vscode like usual

once the file has been saved and you run it you can go to localhost:5000 and then you will see the message corresponfing to the home route

====== What flask does ======

Flask maps http requests to functions, this process is known as routing, this is almost like what you did in relation to node and express 


====== Creating an API ======
To create this API we need data 

we plan to add data to ou API using dictionaries, these dictionaries act as Json objects would using key pair values
